 Registration Challenge
For all the the numbers in Pascal's triangle starting from row 5 up to row 18, 
find the numbers that have a digit sum that is equal to their digit product. 
The solution to the challenge is the total number of all the resulting numbers.
The digit sum of a number is the sum of all digits. Likewise, the digit product
of a number is the product of all digits. For example, the digit sum of 324
is 9 and the digit product is 24.
